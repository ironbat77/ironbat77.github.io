## Overview

Last updated: 2020-11-11

My personal page (resume) built with the powerful d3 library and inspired from
this pretty [info-design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/7990211/Infographic-Design)
by Chen-Wen Liang.

The time line can actually be transposed to anyone's resume by modifying the json input data file.
